- [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B4%BB%E7%9D%80_(%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1) To Live, 活着] My favorate book is To Live written by Yu Hua. Yu Hua is an Chinese author who wins the most literature prizes overseas. I first wanted to read this book because others recommended it to me. When I read it myself, I am deeply attracted by the content. This book describes a rich young men who lost all wealth left by family because of gambling, so he has an unfortuante life afterwards. This book makes me feel the uneasiness of life: living is a lucky thing. This book opens a new world for me, making me understand new life and triggering and inspiring me to find the true meaning of life.
